# ActiveTimeAngular Task Manager v14

This is a simple task manager application built with Angular 2.0.0 and TypeScript. It is a work in progress and is not yet complete.

## How it Works

This application was built using the Angular CLI. The Angular CLI is a command line interface that allows you to quickly create and manage Angular applications. You can learn more about the Angular CLI [here](https://cli.angular.io/).

As a backend, this application uses Firebase. Firebase is a cloud-based NoSQL database that allows you to store and retrieve data in real-time. You can learn more about Firebase [here](https://firebase.google.com/).

## Installation
To run this application, you will need to have Node.js installed. You can download it from [here](https://nodejs.org/en/).

Once you have Node.js installed, you will need to install the Angular CLI. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal:

    npm install --location=global @angular-cli

Once you have the Angular CLI installed, you will need to install the dependencies for this project. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal:

    npm install
  
## Running the Application
